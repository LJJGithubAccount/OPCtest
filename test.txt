WARNING: No writeable variables found.
This test requires that a Server provide writeable variables
which do not change unless written to. The test client application
looks for Nodes within the set of Nodes returned in the Browse/Hierarchial Test
that have a BrowseName of static or are specified in the writeable variables list.
Any variables found as direct or indirect children of these Nodes are assumed to behave as required.
